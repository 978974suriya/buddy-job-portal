# Buddy Job Portal 🧑‍💼🔍

A simple job portal web application built using **Python Flask**, where:

**Job Seekers** can search jobs based on role, skill, location, and salary.
**Recruiters** can search candidates based on name, skill, experience, and location.

This project simulates the basic idea of job matching systems like Naukri or LinkedIn, but built for learning and demonstration.
